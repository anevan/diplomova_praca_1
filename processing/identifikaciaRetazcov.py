       Greedy pathfinding over a correlation matrix.
       At each step, it selects the unvisited attribute most strongly correlated (in absolute value)
       with the current node, and stops when the end node is reached.

       Note: Greedy is shortsighted. It doesn't find all paths—just the locally best.
       So it might miss valid paths like direct edges if they're not the max at each step.

       Parameters:
           matrix (pd.DataFrame): Pruned symmetric correlation matrix (zero means no edge).
           start_node (str): The starting attribute.
           end_node (str): The target attribute.

    Perform a depth-first search (DFS) that always follows the highest absolute correlation neighbors

    the function explores all of them, thus supporting multiple greedy paths from start_node to end_node.

    Because this search is greedy, it may not find a path even if one exists —
    if the path requires taking edges with lower correlations at any step, those are skipped.
    As a result, this function only finds paths that consistently follow the strongest connections.
